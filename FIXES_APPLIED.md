# 🔧 Fixes Applied - October 1, 2025

## ✅ ISSUES FIXED

### Issue #1: Discord Dropdown Limit Exceeded
**Problem:** City dropdown had 29 options (exceeds Discord's 25-option limit)
**Error:** `400 Bad Request - Must be between 1 and 25 in length`

**Solution:**
- ✅ Kept all 8 Tier 1 cities
- ✅ Reduced Tier 2 cities to 15 major cities (from 20)
- ✅ Kept "Other City" option for Tier 3
- ✅ Total: 24 options (within limit!)

**Cities Removed from Dropdown:**
- Amritsar, Raipur, Mysuru, Srinagar, Ajmer
- These are still recognized in the backend if users manually type them
- They're just not in the dropdown to stay under 25 limit

### Issue #2: Bot Stops After Question 3
**Problem:** Bot crashed when trying to show Question 4 (city) due to dropdown error

**Solution:**
- ✅ Fixed dropdown limit
- ✅ Bot now proceeds to all 4 questions
- ✅ No more crashes

### Issue #3: Multiple Welcome Messages
**Problem:** User getting 3 welcome messages from different bot versions

**Solution:**
- ✅ Only ONE welcome message system now
- ✅ Removed old welcome logic
- ✅ Clean, single DM when user joins
