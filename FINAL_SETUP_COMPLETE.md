# ✅ Rusk Media Discord Bot - FINAL SETUP COMPLETE

## 🎉 ALL ISSUES FIXED!

### ✅ Issue #1: Multiple Welcome Messages - FIXED
**Problem:** User receiving 3-4 duplicate welcome messages
**Cause:** Multiple bot instances running simultaneously
**Solution:**
- Killed all old bot instances
- Created `start_bot.sh` script to ensure only ONE bot runs
- Cleaned Python cache to remove old code

### ✅ Issue #2: Bot Stuck at Question 3 - FIXED  
**Problem:** Bot crashing when showing Question 4 (city dropdown)
**Cause:** Too many city options (29) exceeding Discord's 25-option limit
**Solution:**
- Reduced cities to exactly 24 options
- 8 Tier 1 + 15 Tier 2 + 1 "Other City"
- All within Discord's limit!

### ✅ Issue #3: Only ONE Bot Instance Now Running
**Verified:** Only 1 Python process running
**Script:** Use `./start_bot.sh` to ensure clean startup
